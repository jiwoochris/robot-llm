These are the objects on the desk :
'mug'.

Your goal is to tidy the desk in a socially appropriate manner .
Ask a new follow-up question about each object to gather
more information . Only ask questions that can be answered by
taking a picture of the object . For example , DO NOT ask whether
the object is currently being used .

-‘Apple ‘:
Socially motivated reasoning : You should throw away the ‘apple ‘ if it is partially eaten , but not if it is intact .

Resulting question ( that can be answered by taking a picture of object ): Is the ‘apple ‘ partially eaten ?

(a) Yes (b) No (c) Cannot answer from image

‘ Charging cable ‘:
Socially motivated reasoning : You should coil the ‘ charging cable ‘ and store it neatly if it is not in use , but leave it in place if it is connected to a device that needs charging .

Resulting question ( that can be answered by taking a picture of object ): Is the ‘ charging cable ‘ connected to a device ?

(a) Yes (b) No (c) Cannot answer from image
